# Belly-button-biodiversity-

## Overview
  * For this project I created a dashboard to show the different belly button bacteria in human samples. The dashboard can be filtered based on the user input. There is a dropdown list showing the different test subject ID's. Once an id is selected 3 charts will populate. One chart will show the top 10 bacteria cultures found in that test subject's sample. Furthermore, a bubble chart will categorize the different bacteria ID's based on their value. The higher the value yields a larger bubble. The user can also hover over each bubble to get a better understanding of the exact bacteria labels in a given ID. Lastly, a gauge chart will show the scrub frequency of that particular subject. 
  
  * The dashboard can be seen directly on my github with the link below.
